# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Bug Report

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not applying correctly to a component. The expected background color and padding are not being rendered.

## Bug Description

A simple div element with Tailwind CSS classes is not rendering as expected. The background color (`bg-gray-100`) and padding (`p-4`) are not being applied correctly. This issue occurs consistently across different browsers.

## Solution

The issue was caused by missing or incorrectly configured Tailwind CSS setup, in this case, a missing `tailwind.config.js` or incorrect content within it that didn't include the necessary files. This was fixed by adding and configuring this file.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` to see the faulty implementation.
3. Open `bugSolution.js` to see the solution.
4. Run the code using your preferred JavaScript environment.
5. Observe the rendering of the components in both files.
